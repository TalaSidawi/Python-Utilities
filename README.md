# Python-Utilities
Python modules for general FRG use

# Installation Instructions
The following instructions assume that python 3.x and pip are already installed.
  - Open a terminal/command prompt window
    - note: if using Anaconda, use the Anaconda prompt, not OS prompt!
  - run `pip install 'git+https://github.com/fenning-research-group/Python-Utilities.git#egg=frgtools&subdirectory=FrgTools'`
  
 If you have previously installed frgtools and are looking to upgrade to a more recent version, run `pip install 'git+https://github.com/fenning-research-group/Python-Utilities.git#egg=frgtools&subdirectory=FrgTools' --upgrade`


If you want to fork FrgTools and install your forked repo on your virtual environment (to make mini changes without pull requesting to the original every time), run `pip install 'git+https://github.com/TalaSidawi/Python-Utilities.git@master#egg=frgtools&subdirectory=FrgTools'`
